# ARCH-GARCH-Model

Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) is a statistical model used to analyze volatility in time series in order to forecast future volatility. In the financial world, ARCH modeling is used to estimate risk by providing a model of volatility that more closely resembles real markets.

-> KEY TAKEAWAYS :
1) Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models measure volatility and forecast it into the future.
2) ARCH models are dynamic, meaning they respond to changes in the data.
3) ARCH models are used by financial institutions to model asset risks over different holding periods.
4) There are many different types of ARCH models that alter the weightings to provide different views of the same data set.

Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) is a statistical model used in analyzing time-series data where the variance error is believed to be serially autocorrelated. GARCH models assume that the variance of the error term follows an autoregressive moving average process.

-> KEY TAKEAWAYS :
1) GARCH is a statistical modeling technique used to help predict the volatility of returns on financial assets.
2) GARCH is appropriate for time series data where the variance of the error term is serially autocorrelated following an autoregressive moving average process. 
3) GARCH is useful to assess risk and expected returns for assets that exhibit clustered periods of volatility in returns.
